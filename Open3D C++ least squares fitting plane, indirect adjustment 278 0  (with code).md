##  First, the principle of the algorithm 

###  1. Overview of the principle 

  When the traditional least squares method is used to fit the plane of point cloud data, the error can be attributed to only one direction. This paper assumes that the error only exists in the axial direction, and the plane equation of point cloud fitting is:  

  When the number of observation points is, taking the coordinates as the observation value, the observation value equation is:  

  The equation (2) is rewritten as an error equation. According to the least squares criterion, the parameter values are obtained by the equal weight adjustment solution of equation (4), and the calculated plane parameter values are substituted into equation (1) to obtain the plane equation of point cloud fitting.
