##  First, the principle of the algorithm 

  The expression of a plane straight line is: suppose there is a point, so the objective function is: find the partial derivatives of:  

  Let the partial derivatives of equations (3) and (4) be 0 to obtain a system of binary linear equations: 

 Remember, so there are: 

 Solve the above equations to obtain
