   Internal Shape Descriptor (ISS) is a method to represent solid geometry. The algorithm contains rich geometric feature information and can complete high-quality point cloud registration. Set a point in the point cloud, and the specific process of extracting key points is as follows: 1. Establish a local coordinate system for each point in the point cloud and set a search radius for all points;  

2. Determine that each point in the point cloud is centered and is all points within the radius area, and calculate the weights of these points, the expression of which is: 3. Calculate the covariance matrix for each point: 4. Calculate the eigenvalues {} of the covariance matrix for each point and arrange them in order from largest to smallest; 5. Select the key points according to the following rules. The significance feature is the smallest eigenvalue: The value of usually does not exceed 1. The basic principle is to avoid detecting key points at points where similar diffusion occurs along the main direction. Since a repeatable standard reference frame cannot be established, it is difficult for the subsequent description stage to produce an effect. In the remaining points, the significance depends on the size of the smallest eigenvalue. Non-maximum suppression () is performed on the significant features within the set radius, and the points with large changes in the main direction are reserved as key points.
