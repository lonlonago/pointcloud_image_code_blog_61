##  First, the principle of the algorithm 

  The general expression of the plane equation is as follows: Remember: Substituting equation (3) into equation (2) yields equation (4): For a series of points;, use this point to fit the plane equation, even if:  

  To make the minimum, the two sides of equation (4) should be found to be partial derivative, and the partial derivative should be zero. That is, rewrite it into a matrix form as: solve the equation system (7) to obtain the parameters, and substitute formula (4) to obtain the plane equation.
