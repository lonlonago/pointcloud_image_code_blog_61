##  First, grid extraction 

  Another way to simplify meshes is to perform step-by-step mesh extraction. Select a triangle removal that minimizes the error metric. Repeat this process until the specified number of triangles is met. Open3d implements SimplifyQuadricDecimation interface to minimize the error square (distance from adjacent planes), and the parameter target_number_of_triangles defines the number of facets to stop extracting.
