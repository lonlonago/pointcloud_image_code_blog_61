##  I. Overview of algorithms 

  Model refinement involves dividing each triangle into smaller triangles. The simplest way is to calculate the midpoint of each side of the triangle and divide it into four smaller triangles. This is achieved through the SubdivideLoop function. The 3D surface and area remain the same, but the number of vertices and triangles increases. number_of_iterations parameter defines the number of refinements.

 ```  
This function converts a triangle into four triangles that cover the same surface.
