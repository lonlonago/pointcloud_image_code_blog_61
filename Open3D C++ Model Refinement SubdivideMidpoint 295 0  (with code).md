##  I. Overview of algorithms 

  Triangles are refined using a simple midpoint algorithm. Each iteration subdivides the triangle into four triangles, with the subdivided vertices located at the midpoint of the original triangle's edge. number_of_iterations parameter defines the number of refinements.
